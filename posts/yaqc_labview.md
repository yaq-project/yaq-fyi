A LabVIEW library for base yaq traits has been developed and posted to the yaq-project repository. This library will be amended when additional base traits are YEPped.
The readme markdown included with the library provides a short tutorial on how the LabVIEW library works and how you can integrate it within your yaq and LabVIEW projects.
